# Decoder-Ring-Project
Application for encryption and decryption of three types of cyphers.
The project can take a message encoded with a Caesar cipher, Polybius Square, or Substitution cipher, and will return a decoded message. This project was built using JavaScript in order to practice with newly developed skills. In the future, I plan to add more cipher options in order to widen the range of its usefulness.

To run the application:

>Fork and clone the repo
 
>npm i
 
>npm start
